plt.text(x, y, r'some text'): can add text to a graph (don't need to use annotate)

# fftpack
# by default, the first half of the values correspond to positive frequencies,
# and the second half correspond to negative frequencies. These can be shifted
# by using fftshift, but if you have generated the frequencies with fftfreq, you
# can plot together without shifting either the FT or the frequency arrays.
# a more spread out spectrum will mean that the pitch is higher. Lower pitches
# will have more frequencies in the neighborhood around zero hertz.
